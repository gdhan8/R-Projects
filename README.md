ZHVI Zip-code Intereactive Map

Inputs Zillow home value index (ZHVI) zip-code data uses R and the Leaflet package to create an interactive choropleth map displaying ZHVI average, 5 year growth rate, and 10 year growth rate. The visualization enables the user, home buyer, or investor to easily identify areas with the greatest home value appreciation.

Publicly available information from a Real Estate Website was sourced, transformed, filtered, and joined with zip-code shape-file data to create an interactive chloropleth map of five year home value index growth rates. 

The tool helps achieve a decision by making already available information more accessible to a buyer or investor.

A second, Virginia R file is included with a center view on Northern Virginia. Updated Dec 30, 2022.
